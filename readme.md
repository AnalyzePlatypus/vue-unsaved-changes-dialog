## Install (not live yet)

```bash
npm i vue-unsaved-changes-dialog
```

## Usage

```html
<coming soon>
```

```javascript
// Soon!
```

## Live Development

You'll need [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) and the [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html).

```bash
npm install 
npm run serve
```

## Building

You'll need to install [Rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) to run the build script.
Install it with `npm install --g rollup` 

```
npm run build
```

Running the build script generate `main` (`.ssr.js`), `module` (`.esm.js`), and `unpkg` (`.min.js`) versions in the `dist` directory.
